Hi, I'm Chris Trivino, my goal is to one day work  in military research implementing machine learning and AI techniques/algorithms. I'm currently learning all I can about machine learning and deep learning. I am currently at defense contractor data scientist at LinQuest. I have enjoyed all of the projects I have been able to complete in the data science realm and am excited to learn more.

I'm looking to collaborate on projects that have to do with defense and/or image recognition. I have worked on projects like finding statistics on drone strikes and have worked on image and sound classifcation projects. 

Please feel free to contact me to talk about my projects or employment opportunities!
