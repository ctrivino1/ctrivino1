Hi, I'm Chris Trivino, my goal is to one day work  in military research implementing machine learning and AI techniques/algorithms. I'm currently learning all I can about machine learning and deep learning. I am majoring in mathematics so that I can become a better Data Scientist and one day become a Machine Learning Engineer. I am a senior at Brigham Young University-Idaho and I am excited to get my feet wet in the world of research and technology. 

I'm looking to collaborate on projects that have to do with defense. I have worked on projects like finding statistics on drone strikes and improving drone algorithms for ground distance.

Please feel free to contact me to talk about my projects or employment opportunities!
