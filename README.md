Hi, I'm Chris Trivino, I am interested in working in military research with machine learning and AI techniques/algorithms. I'm currently diving deep into learning machine learning and deep learning. I also am majoring in mathematics so that I don't hit a roof with my data science / machine learning skills. I am a senior at Brigham Young University-Idaho and I'm excited to get my feet wet in the world of research and technology. 

I'm looking to collaborate on projects that have to do with defense. I have worked on projects like finding statistics on drone strikes and improving drone algorithms for ground distance.

Please feel free to contact me to talk about projects, research, or even employement purposes.
